API Handoff Notes for Backend Team
==================================

**Status:**
- All API endpoints for AI integration are implemented, tested, and passing all automated tests.
- Celery tasks, DRF viewsets, and authentication are production-ready.

**Key Implementation Details:**

1. **Celery Tasks**
   - All async processing (content generation, sentiment analysis, etc.) is handled by Celery tasks.
   - Tasks are decorated with `@shared_task` and can be called with `.delay()`.
   - See: `ai_integration/tasks.py`

2. **DRF ViewSets & Endpoints**
   - All endpoints are implemented as DRF ViewSets with proper action methods.
   - All custom actions are synchronous (`def`, not `async def`).
   - Endpoints are available under `/api/ai/` (see `mukiisa_backend/urls.py`).
   - Example endpoints:
     - `POST /api/ai/content/generate-post/`
     - `POST /api/ai/sentiment/analyze-comment/`
     - `GET /api/ai/tasks/` (history)
     - `GET /api/ai/tasks/usage-stats/`

3. **Authentication & Permissions**
   - Uses DRF `BasicAuthentication` by default (see `settings.py`).
   - All endpoints require authentication (`IsAuthenticated`).
   - Unauthenticated requests return 401 Unauthorized.

4. **Validation & Error Handling**
   - All serializer and business logic validation errors return proper 400/4xx codes.
   - Internal errors are logged and return 500.

5. **Testing**
   - All tests pass (`pytest ai_integration/tests/`).
   - Test coverage includes endpoints, serializers, models, middleware, and Celery task logic.

**Integration Notes:**
- To trigger async processing, call the relevant Celery task with `.delay()`.
- All endpoints expect and return JSON.
- See `ai_integration/urls.py` for route names and patterns.
- For any new endpoints, follow the same ViewSet/action/task pattern.
